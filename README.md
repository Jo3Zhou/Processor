# Processor
A processor based on VHDL with components followed below:
1. Processing Unit (ALU, (parameterizable) register bank, data path)
2. Control Unit (insturction register, sequencer, decode logic)
3. MMU memory management unit
4. Dual-port ROM
5. Ouput register

P.S. A processor with lots of bugs from assignment on course xD
